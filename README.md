# Ai-hackathon - Second place Winner
Ai-hackathon for Uchicago DSI

We built Genesis.AI, a retrieval-augmented chatbot that securely accesses patient records and answers general medical questions. To enable a seamless, end-to-end medical Q&A chatbot using entirely open-source tools. Our stack includes:

- **LangChain** for orchestration
- **PostgreSQL** (with vector embeddings) as both relational and vector databases
- **Streamlit** for the front-end
- **Google Cloud Vertex AI** to host and fine-tune **Llama 3-8B**

Key innovations:

1. **Dynamic SQL Generation**
    - Fine-tuned Llama 3-8B to translate natural-language medical queries into SQL on the fly.
    - Executes those SQL queries against patient tables and metadata.
2. **Vector Retrieval**
    - Indexes medical reports in PostgreSQLâ€™s vector store.
    - Uses the same SQL-driven pipeline to retrieve relevant unstructured data.
3. **Accurate Response Generation**
    - Further fine-tuned Llama 3-8B to synthesize structured and vector-retrieved information into precise, context-aware answers.
